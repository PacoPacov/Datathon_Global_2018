Predictive maintenance



2. Data Understanding

Time series data from velocity and acceleration measurement was provided for 7 machines and 6 sensors for each machine.

Initial understanding the data was complicated, due to the high amount of records and not well structured dataset. However, this is often the case in real-life problems, so here is a list of prep actions that we have taken:

Aggregated data on machine, sensor type, hourly basis, daily basis
We are using max daily value
Filled in missing dates from the time series and padded the values with the value from the closest date


To understand what data we have it is important to look at descriptive statistics and explore graphs.

Additional data was provided for some of the maintenance events like grinding the rails and change of parts.

3. Data Preparation

3.1 Time series components

Since data is provided as a time series, it makes sense to look at standard analytics (unit root test, acf, pacf).

As expected, unit root test of the series showed that data is non-stationary.

ACF and PACF results show significant lags to be present in the series.

ACF:



PACF:



3.2 Fourier transform

Fourrier transform was applied to a dummy variable that shows whether tests where run on that date or not.

Results show strong cyclical component on approximately 100 days:



Our main assumption is, that these 100-days cycle is a regular maintenance of the machine (like grinding, changing parts, setup, etc.). However, this was not confirmed by the repair records data provided by the organizers.

3.3 Missing dates analysis

The number of consequently missing days with observations also may be a strong predictor for the machine performance. For example, if the machine was idle only for a day, it was probably a small maintenance event, while long periods with no observations can suggest a significant failure.

For example, for two of the machines the number of consequent missing days shows the following distribution:

RBG1	RBG7
1.0	6.0	9.0
2.0	40.0	70.0
3.0	12.0	30.0
4.0	NaN	12.0
5.0	5.0	NaN
6.0	NaN	6.0
7.0	NaN	14.0
9.0	NaN	9.0
11.0	NaN	11.0
13.0	13.0	NaN
17.0	NaN	17.0
20.0	40.0	NaN
28.0	28.0	NaN
217.0	217.0	NaN
